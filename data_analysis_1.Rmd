## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## 5.3 Get the Gapminder data

We will work with some of the data from the Gapminder project. I’ve released this as an R package, so we can install it from CRAN like so:

```{r gapminder package}
install.packages("gapminder")
```

Now load the package:

```{r loading the package}
library(gapminder)
```

## 5.4 Meet the gapminder data frame or “tibble”

By loading the gapminder package, we now have access to a data frame by the same name. Get an overview of this with str(), which displays the structure of an object.

```{r an overview}
str(gapminder)
```

Now load it:

```{r load tidyverse}
library(tidyverse)
```


## see? it's still a regular data frame, but also a tibble

```{r class of gapminder}
class(gapminder)
```

```{r call gapminder}
gapminder
```

## A statistical overview can be obtained with summary():

```{r summary stats}
summary(gapminder)
```

Although we haven’t begun our formal coverage of visualization yet, it’s so important for smell-testing dataset that we will make a few figures anyway. Here we use only base R graphics, which are very basic.

```{r plots using base}
plot(lifeExp ~ year, gapminder)
```

```{r plot using gdp_pc}
plot(lifeExp ~ gdpPercap, gapminder)
```


```{r plot using log gdp_pc}
plot(lifeExp ~ log(gdpPercap), gapminder)
```

Let’s go back to the result of str() to talk about what a data frame is.

```{r dataframe overview}
str(gapminder)
```

A data frame is a special case of a list, which is used in R to hold just about anything. Data frames are a special case where the length of each list component is the same. Data frames are superior to matrices in R because they can hold vectors of different flavors, e.g. numeric, character, and categorical data can be stored together. This comes up a lot!

## 5.5 Look at the variables inside a data frame

To specify a single variable from a data frame, use the dollar sign $. Let’s explore the numeric variable for life expectancy.

```{r first 10 rows}
head(gapminder$lifeExp)
```

```{r summary stats}
summary(gapminder$lifeExp)
```

```{r histogram}
hist(gapminder$lifeExp)
```

The year variable is an integer variable, but since there are so few unique values it also functions a bit like a categorical variable.
